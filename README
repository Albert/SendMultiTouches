Hello!

This is a small bit of code that will allow you to send multitouch data
from a MacBook trackpad via OSC. I bundled together two lovely bits of code:
http://gruntthepeon.free.fr/oscpkt/
http://steike.com/code/multitouch/

Thanks guys!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This has only been tested using OSX Lion on the latest MacBook Air.
It will probably work on almost all recent MacBooks, and possibly Macs
using a Magic Trackpad, on most recent versions of OSX.

This also requires some developer tools, for g++ and make.

In order to compile and run the demos, just expand enter this directory
in the command line and run the command "make". If the command doesn't
work, then you might not have the developer tools installed. If it
didn't work for some other reason, I don't know why!

If you do have it working, though, you can run the multitouch OSC sender
with the command "./sendMultiTouches". Optionally, append "-v" to output
the messages it's sending, and "-p PORTNUM" to send them to a port other
than the default, which is 9189.

Run the test receiver using "./testReceiver" to test that the OSC messages
are being sent and received correctly on port 9189.

Right now, the messages take the format:

address i32 f       f       f       f
/finger	id  xpos    ypos    xvel    yvel

If you want to add more parameters they are pretty transparent in the code.

Have fun!
